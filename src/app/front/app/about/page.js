            GolemVR is a web-based application designed to create deepfake transformations featuring the popular figure "Pudzian".
            Users can easily upload their own video clips, and the system automatically processes the content, transforming the subject
            into a realistic deepfake representation of Pudzian. The project's goal is to provide users with an engaging, accessible,
            and entertaining experience powered by modern deepfake technology and artificial intelligence.
